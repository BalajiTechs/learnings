## Usage

- There are lots of cool tools bundled in powertoys. One of the cools tool I like is [powertoys-run](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys#powertoys-run)(Just like spotlite in macOS). Once powertoy is running, Press ALT+Space (default keybinding) and you will see a search bar at the middile of screen. Type in and application name and it works perfectly.

Checkout github repo [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) for more information.
